# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Rustrland is a Rust implementation of Pyprland for Hyprland - a fast, reliable plugin system that provides dropdown terminals, window management, and other window manager enhancements. It's designed as a drop-in replacement for Pyprland with better performance and memory safety.

## Architecture

The codebase follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Daemon (`src/main.rs`)**: Main daemon process that runs continuously, manages Hyprland connections and coordinates plugins
- **Client (`src/client.rs`)**: Command-line client (`rustr`) for sending commands to the running daemon via IPC
- **Library (`src/lib.rs`)**: Shared library with common types and IPC protocol
- **Core System (`src/core/`)**: 
  - `daemon.rs`: Core daemon lifecycle and event loop management
  - `plugin_manager.rs`: Loads and manages plugins dynamically with Hyprland client injection and hot reload support
  - `event_handler.rs`: Processes Hyprland window manager events
  - `hot_reload.rs`: File watching and configuration hot-reloading system with plugin state preservation
- **Configuration (`src/config/`)**: TOML-based configuration system compatible with Pyprland syntax
- **IPC (`src/ipc/`)**: 
  - `mod.rs`: Hyprland IPC client with window management functions
  - `enhanced_client.rs`: Production-ready enhanced client with reconnection logic and performance optimizations
  - `protocol.rs`: Client-daemon IPC message definitions
  - `server.rs`: Unix socket server for client-daemon communication
- **Animation (`src/animation/`)**: Comprehensive animation system for smooth transitions
  - `timeline.rs`: Keyframe-based animation timelines with easing support
  - `easing.rs`: Complete easing functions library (linear, bezier, bounce, elastic, etc.)
  - `properties.rs`: Animation property interpolation with color and transform support
- **Plugins (`src/plugins/`)**: Modular plugin system with production-ready scratchpads plugin

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
# Run in development mode with debug output
make run
cargo run --bin rustrland -- --debug --foreground

# Run with example configuration
make run-example
cargo run --bin rustrland -- --config examples/rustrland.toml --debug --foreground

# Auto-reload during development (requires cargo-watch)
make dev

# Run client commands
cargo run --bin rustr -- toggle term        # Toggle terminal scratchpad
cargo run --bin rustr -- toggle browser     # Toggle browser scratchpad  
cargo run --bin rustr -- toggle filemanager # Toggle file manager scratchpad
cargo run --bin rustr -- expose             # Show window overview (Mission Control)
cargo run --bin rustr -- expose next        # Navigate to next window
cargo run --bin rustr -- expose exit        # Exit expose mode
cargo run --bin rustr -- workspace switch 2 # Switch to workspace 2 (cross-monitor)
cargo run --bin rustr -- workspace change +1 # Next workspace
cargo run --bin rustr -- workspace list     # List workspaces and monitors
cargo run --bin rustr -- list               # List all available scratchpads
cargo run --bin rustr -- status             # Show daemon status and uptime
```

### Build and Test
```bash
# Build project
make build
cargo build

# Run tests
make test  
cargo test

# Check compilation without building
make check
cargo check
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
make fmt
cargo fmt

# Check format without changing files
make fmt-check
cargo fmt --check

# Lint with clippy (fails on warnings)
make lint
cargo clippy --lib --bins -- -D warnings

# Full CI pipeline (matches GitHub CI exactly)
make ci  # Equivalent to: fmt-check lint test build-release

# Pre-push validation (run before every push)
./scripts/pre-push.sh
```

### **IMPORTANT: Pre-Push Validation**

**Always run pre-push validation before pushing to GitHub:**

```bash
# Option 1: Use the make target
make ci

# Option 2: Use the dedicated script  
./scripts/pre-push.sh

# Option 3: Git pre-push hook (automatic)
# Hook is already installed and runs automatically on git push
```

**The pre-push hook will automatically run these checks:**
- âœ… Code formatting (`cargo fmt --check`)
- âœ… Clippy linting (`cargo clippy --lib --bins -- -D warnings`) 
- âœ… Unit tests (`cargo test --lib`)
- âœ… Release build (`cargo build --release`)

**If any check fails, the push is blocked.** This ensures professional code quality.

### Installation
```bash
# Install locally
make install
cargo install --path .
```

## Configuration

Rustrland supports dual configuration formats for maximum compatibility:

### Configuration Formats
- **Pyprland Format**: `[pyprland]` - Full compatibility with existing Pyprland configs
- **Rustrland Format**: `[rustrland]` - Native format with enhanced features  
- **Dual Format**: Both sections in one file - Rustrland merges them intelligently

### Configuration Files
- Default location: `~/.config/hypr/rustrland.toml`
- Example configurations: `examples/pyprland-compatible.toml`, `examples/rustrland-native.toml`, `examples/dual-config.toml`
- Supports variable substitution with `[variable_name]` syntax in both formats

### Configuration Merging Rules
- Both `[pyprland]` and `[rustrland]` sections are processed
- Plugin lists are merged (duplicates removed)
- Variables from `[rustrland.variables]` override `[pyprland.variables]`
- Existing Pyprland configurations work without modification

## Keyboard Integration

For seamless usage, add these keybindings to your `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```bash
# Rustrland Scratchpad Keybindings
bind = SUPER, grave, exec, rustr toggle term        # Super + ` (backtick)
bind = SUPER, B, exec, rustr toggle browser         # Super + B
bind = SUPER, F, exec, rustr toggle filemanager     # Super + F  
bind = SUPER, M, exec, rustr toggle music           # Super + M
bind = SUPER, TAB, exec, rustr expose               # Super + Tab (expose)
bind = SUPER, 1, exec, rustr workspace switch 1     # Super + 1 (workspace 1)
bind = SUPER, 2, exec, rustr workspace switch 2     # Super + 2 (workspace 2)
bind = SUPER, Right, exec, rustr workspace change +1 # Super + Right (next workspace)
bind = SUPER, Left, exec, rustr workspace change -- -1 # Super + Left (prev workspace)
bind = SUPER, L, exec, rustr list                   # Super + L (list all)
bind = SUPER_SHIFT, S, exec, rustr status           # Super + Shift + S
```

See `KEYBINDINGS.md` for complete setup guide and alternative key schemes.
