group_by_class = true            # Group windows with same class
group_by_workspace_origin = true # Group by original workspace

# Group behavior
group_animation_delay = 50       # Delay between animating windows in group
group_focus_behavior = "cycle"   # "cycle", "stack", "spread"
```

## Use Cases and Examples

### Quick Calculator

[toggle_special]
# Quick access calculator setup
auto_launch_apps = ["gnome-calculator"]
auto_launch_delay = 100          # Launch after showing special workspace

[toggle_special.window_management.auto_placement_rules]
calculator = { 
    app = "gnome-calculator", 
    position = "center", 
    size = "300x400",
    always_on_top = true
}
```

### Note-Taking Workspace

special_workspace_name = "notes"
auto_launch_apps = ["obsidian", "xournalpp"]

# Organize note-taking tools
[toggle_special.window_management]
organization_style = "tiles"
tile_layout = "vertical_split"   # Split vertically for text + drawing
```

### System Monitoring

```bash
# Launch system monitors on special workspace
rustr special show
rustr special move-here &
htop &  # Process monitor
iotop & # I/O monitor
nethogs & # Network monitor
```

### Development Scratch Space

    position = "left",
    size = "70% 100%"
}
terminal_scratch = {
    app = "gnome-terminal", 
    position = "right",
    size = "30% 100%"
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Animation Performance

```toml
[toggle_special.performance]
# Optimize animations for performance
hardware_acceleration = true     # Use GPU when available
animation_quality = "medium"     # "low", "medium", "high"
vsync_aware = true               # Sync with display refresh rate
reduce_animations_on_battery = true # Reduce effects on battery power

# Memory management
cache_animation_frames = true    # Cache pre-rendered animation frames
max_cache_size = 32              # Maximum cache size in MB
cleanup_cache_interval = 300    # Cache cleanup interval in seconds
```

### Window Management Performance

```toml
[toggle_special.performance.window_management]
# Efficient window operations
batch_window_operations = true  # Batch multiple window operations
async_window_placement = true   # Asynchronous window placement
lazy_window_loading = true      # Load window information on demand

# Resource limits
max_windows_on_special = 20     # Limit windows on special workspace
window_info_cache_size = 100    # Cache size for window information
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Special workspace not showing:**
```bash
# Check plugin status
rustr special status

# Test without animation
rustr special no-animation

# Check Hyprland special workspace
hyprctl dispatch togglespecialworkspace
```

**Animation issues:**
```toml
[toggle_special]
hardware_acceleration = false   # Disable if causing problems
animation_duration = 100        # Reduce duration
animation = "fade"              # Use simpler animation
```

**Focus problems:**
```toml
[toggle_special]
focus_on_toggle = false         # Disable automatic focus
restore_focus_on_hide = false   # Don't restore focus
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Debug special workspace functionality
rustr special status            # Show detailed status
rustr special info              # Show configuration info
rustr special test-animation    # Test animation without showing

# Hyprland integration debugging
rustr special hyprland-status   # Check Hyprland special workspace status
rustr special window-debug      # Debug window management
```

## Migration and Compatibility

### From Standard Hyprland Special Workspace

Rustrland's toggle special plugin enhances the standard Hyprland special workspace with:
- Smooth animations
- Better window management
- Multi-monitor support
- Configurable behavior

### Migration Steps

1. **Replace Keybindings**: Replace `hyprctl dispatch togglespecialworkspace` with `rustr toggle-special`
2. **Add Configuration**: Add `[toggle_special]` configuration section
3. **Test Functionality**: Verify enhanced features work as expected

## Best Practices

### Configuration Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic toggle functionality before adding complex features
2. **Test Animations**: Test different animation types to find what works best
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check animation performance on your hardware
4. **Use Appropriate Keybindings**: Choose convenient and memorable keybindings

### Usage Tips

1. **Quick Access**: Use toggle special for frequently accessed utilities
2. **Temporary Workspaces**: Use for temporary work that doesn't belong in regular workspaces
3. **System Tools**: Great for system monitoring and administrative tools
4. **Scratch Work**: Perfect for quick notes, calculations, and temporary tasks

### Performance Tips

1. **Limit Windows**: Don't overload special workspace with too many windows
2. **Optimize Animations**: Choose appropriate animation settings for your hardware
3. **Cache Settings**: Enable caching for better performance with many windows
4. **Hardware Acceleration**: Use GPU acceleration when available
