```

## Placement Rules

### Basic Positioning

```toml
[monitors]
placement_rules = [
    # Primary monitor (always positioned first)
    { monitor = "DP-1", position = "primary" },
    
    # Relative positioning
    { monitor = "DP-2", position = { right_of = "DP-1" } },
    { monitor = "DP-3", position = { left_of = "DP-1" } },
    { monitor = "HDMI-1", position = { above = "DP-1" } },
    { monitor = "HDMI-2", position = { below = "DP-1" } },
]
```

### Conditional Placement

```toml
[monitors]
placement_rules = [
    # Primary monitor
    { monitor = "DP-1", position = "primary", conditions = ["always"] },
    
    # Conditional placement based on monitor presence
    { 
        monitor = "DP-2", 
        position = { right_of = "DP-1" },
        conditions = ["if_present:DP-1"]
    },
    
    # Fallback positioning
    {
        monitor = "HDMI-1",
        position = { left_of = "DP-1" },
        conditions = ["if_absent:DP-2"]
    },

    # Complex conditions
    {
        monitor = "eDP-1",  # Laptop screen
        position = { below = "DP-1" },
        conditions = ["if_present:DP-1", "if_laptop"]
    }
]
```

### Advanced Positioning

```toml
[monitors]
# Exact positioning with coordinates
placement_rules = [
    { monitor = "DP-1", position = { x = 0, y = 0 } },
    { monitor = "DP-2", position = { x = 3840, y = 0 } },
    { monitor = "DP-3", position = { x = 1920, y = -1080 } },
]

# Calculated positioning with offsets
placement_rules = [
    { monitor = "DP-1", position = "primary" },
    { 
        monitor = "DP-2", 
        position = { right_of = "DP-1", offset = { x = 50, y = -100 } }
    },
]
```

## Monitor Profiles

### Profile Management

Monitor profiles allow you to save and quickly switch between different monitor configurations:

```toml
[monitors.profiles]
# Home setup: Single 4K monitor
home = {
    monitors = [
        { name = "DP-1", resolution = "3840x2160", refresh_rate = 60, scale = 1.5, primary = true }
    ]
}

# Office setup: Dual monitor
office = {
    monitors = [
        { name = "DP-1", resolution = "3840x2160", refresh_rate = 144, scale = 1.5, primary = true },
        { name = "DP-2", resolution = "2560x1440", refresh_rate = 165, scale = 1.0, position = { right_of = "DP-1" } }
    ]
}

# Presentation setup: Mirror to projector
presentation = {
    monitors = [
        { name = "DP-1", resolution = "1920x1080", refresh_rate = 60, scale = 1.0, primary = true },
        { name = "HDMI-1", resolution = "1920x1080", refresh_rate = 60, scale = 1.0, mirror = "DP-1" }
    ]
}

# Gaming setup: Single high refresh rate monitor
gaming = {
    monitors = [
        { name = "DP-1", resolution = "2560x1440", refresh_rate = 240, scale = 1.0, primary = true, adaptive_sync = true }
    ]
}
```

### Profile Commands

```bash
# Profile management
rustr monitors save-profile "current-setup"    # Save current configuration
rustr monitors load-profile "gaming"           # Switch to gaming profile
rustr monitors auto-profile                    # Auto-detect and switch profile
rustr monitors profile-info "office"           # Show profile details
```

## Hotplug Support

### Automatic Detection

```toml
[monitors.hotplug]
# Hotplug configuration
enabled = true
detection_delay = 1000          # Wait 1 second after hotplug event
auto_configure = true           # Automatically configure new monitors
preserve_layout = true          # Maintain existing layout when possible
notify_changes = true           # Show notifications for monitor changes

# Hotplug rules
rules = [
    # When DP-2 is connected, apply office profile
    { event = "connected", monitor = "DP-2", action = "load_profile:office" },
    
    # When HDMI-1 is connected, mirror primary
    { event = "connected", monitor = "HDMI-1", action = "mirror_primary" },
    
    # When laptop lid is closed, disable eDP-1
    { event = "lid_closed", monitor = "eDP-1", action = "disable" },
]
```

### Hotplug Events

The monitors plugin responds to various hotplug events:

- **Monitor Connected**: New monitor plugged in
- **Monitor Disconnected**: Monitor unplugged
- **Resolution Changed**: Monitor resolution changed externally
- **Lid Events**: Laptop lid opened/closed (when applicable)
- **Dock Events**: Docking station connected/disconnected

## Hardware Acceleration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Monitor not detected:**
```bash
# Check monitor detection
rustr monitors detect
rustr monitors list

# Force rescan
rustr monitors rescan
```

**Incorrect positioning:**
```bash
# Test monitor layout
rustr monitors test
rustr monitors relayout

# Check placement rules
rustr monitors status
```

**Performance issues:**
```toml
[monitors.performance]
hardware_acceleration = false  # Disable if causing issues
async_operations = false       # Synchronous operations
reduce_polling = true          # Reduce polling frequency
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Debug monitor configuration
rustr monitors status          # Detailed monitor status
rustr monitors capabilities    # Show monitor capabilities
rustr monitors test-config     # Test current configuration

# Hardware information
rustr monitors gpu-info        # GPU and acceleration info
rustr monitors driver-info     # Display driver information
```

### Monitor Detection Issues

```bash
# Force monitor detection
rustr monitors force-detect

# Check hardware support
rustr monitors hardware-test

# Verify connections
rustr monitors connection-test DP-1
```

## Migration and Compatibility

### From Other Monitor Tools

- **xrandr**: Direct migration of xrandr configurations
- **kanshi**: Compatible with kanshi-style configurations
- **autorandr**: Similar profile-based management
- **System Settings**: GUI equivalent functionality

### Configuration Migration

```bash
# Import from xrandr
rustr monitors import-xrandr ~/.config/xrandr/setup.sh

# Import from kanshi
rustr monitors import-kanshi ~/.config/kanshi/config

# Export current configuration
rustr monitors export-config ~/.config/rustrland/monitors.toml
```

## Best Practices

### Setup Recommendations

1. **Start with Primary**: Always configure primary monitor first
2. **Use Relative Positioning**: Prefer relative positioning over absolute coordinates
3. **Enable Hotplug**: Enable hotplug for dynamic environments
4. **Save Profiles**: Create profiles for different scenarios
5. **Test Configurations**: Always test before applying permanently

### Performance Tips

1. **Enable Hardware Acceleration**: Use GPU acceleration when available
2. **Cache Monitor Info**: Enable caching for better performance
3. **Batch Changes**: Apply multiple monitor changes together
4. **Optimize Polling**: Reduce polling frequency when not needed

### Multi-Monitor Best Practices

1. **Consistent Scaling**: Use consistent DPI scaling across monitors
2. **Proper Alignment**: Align monitors properly for smooth cursor movement
3. **Workspace Assignment**: Assign specific workspaces to monitors
4. **Application Placement**: Configure applications for specific monitors
